1. Introduction1.1. Document Identifier      This is a product requirement document (PRD) specific for this project.    The name of the project is “MY Cars”. This document describes the vision of the project on that certain version (version can be seen on page 1).       This document will specify:* The goal of the project* Technical and knowledge requirements* Tasks and their deadlines* The workforce1.2. ScopeThis document will be the holy grail of this project. Any changes of the plan, extensions of the deadlines, and features should be reported in this document. Any additions should be reported in “Document history” section (page 2). Any changes of the document have to be approved by the creator of the project. Changes onto the document are illegal if not notified beforehand. Anything in here must be 100% true and no short cuts must be made for the sake of easiness if not approved beforehand.  All the contents have to be clear: if acronyms, terms from slang, technical and literal words are used have to be reported in the “Definition of terms and Acronyms” section. Anything which diverges from the set goals have to be reported in the document in the most meticulous way possible. Divergences like that can be: errors, sources, dependencies, Risks and Schedule.  For assumption special content is created. Concerning on all of the other parts of the contents NO ASSUMPTIONS SHOULD BE MADE, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CALCULATED AND BACKED UP BY REAL DATA ANALYSIS. References should be clear, have to be numerically numbered and reported in the section solely created for it.  1.3. Definitions of Terms and AcronymsThe name of the project – MY CarsRAM - Random Access Memory GUI - Graphical User Interface OS - Operating SystemAWD – All Wheel DriveFWD – Front Wheel DriveRWD – Rear Wheel Drive1.4. ReferencesN/A1.5. OverviewThe goal of this project is to create a platform that will allow the user, to search for the exact model of the car they are looking for, (in future of everything placed in the database). The process will be done using filters of any characteristic (e.g., the engine size, color, year of production, etc.) a car has. The cars that are placed to be sold in Armenia, on website https://auto.am will be used as a Database. 
2. Requirements2.1. Functional RequirementsThe initial features have to be specified below (any changes to the initial features have to be approved beforehand): 	The platform has filters such as:*  The manufacturer* Model* Year* Engine Size* Horsepower* Price* Wheel Placement* Type of Engine* Gear Box* AWD RWD FWDAt first, some options of filtration will be proposed. So the user will decide if he/she wants to filter some cars out. To avoid insertion mistakes, top results will be illustrated to be inserted with numbers like: “input 1 to search a Mercedes-Benz” but also there would be an “other” option. After all the filters are selected, the user will receive a file with all the cars that match the selected filters. 2.2. Platform Requirements* Supported OS:o MacOso Ubuntu* 4GB RAM* 5 GB free memory space2.3. Implementation RequirementsThe Program will be developed in Python. 2.4. Performance RequirementsThe complexity of the program will be equal to O(n). 2.5. Verification RequirementsThe provided application should be verified for all the supported platforms. The tests will be run manually with the blind-testing method.2.6. Documentation RequirementsThe project should have an initial README file describing the meaning and usage of the program. Later on, a brief user manual will be developed for the application part.
